# WKP5-A project for this weekend

# The way how to succed the code

In this project, there are some ways that I tried to code
  -  The array of object needed is already given but need to check if it is right array by using .entry() method.
   -  Generating the HTML by creating it, call all the object needed inside the the all elements and succeed the HTML by using insertAdjacentHTML afterbegin or innerHTML 
   -  Making funtion to handle for all of the button clicks
   - Creating the open modal class and use the outside click to remove it or by pressing the escape keybord

## Requirement

As the instruction asked me to do, I tried to finish those which I can do my best to meet the requirements but in many problems that I have been confronted I didn't complete all the requirements such as making the list of the steps and the ingredients, returning the moreinfo modal after clicking the add recipes ...etc. 

## Additional enhancement

I really need to improve my code on how to make lists by using arrays of objects, calling the HTML from the HTML code, returning something in the origine place and accessing the input from. Therefore, if I have more time I will do all of them to make it perfect

## Leaving error

So far I try not to have any error on my code and not push it untill I solve it.
